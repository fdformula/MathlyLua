## [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) is a very good "IDE" for Lua + Mathly

It is smaller and faster than [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl). You can download here the customized versions for Windows, Linux, and
MacOS. While in Lite XL, press
```
  F1               to open help document on current Lua/Mathly function
  F2               to start Lua interpreter with Mathly loaded in the folder of the current file
  Ctrl-,           to run the command on current line or selected code in the editor
  Ctrl-.           to run all code in the editor (HTML file? open it in a browser)
```

Other hotkeys? Refer to `C:\cygwin\cudatext\cudatext-hotkeys-for-plugins.txt`.

&rArr; Microsoft Windows users may download on this very page the file, `cudatext-for-mathly-win-*.7z`. It includes a text editor, CudaText, with Lua 5.4.8 and
Mathly integrated. Run [7zip](https://7-zip.org/) to extract it to C:\ (the root directory of the C drive). <em>Do not change the name of the folder,
`C:\cygwin`</em>.

&rArr; Linux users? For most Linux distributions, download the file, [cudatext-for-mathly-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/fdformula/MathlyLua/blob/main/cudatext-for-mathly-linux.tar.gz).
For other distributions like Fedora, download the file, [cudatext-for-mathly-linux-RARE.tar.gz](https://github.com/fdformula/MathlyLua/blob/main/cudatext-for-mathly-linux-RARE.tar.gz).
Expand the downloaded file and refer to the included file, `note.txt`, for other steps.

&rArr; MacOS users? Download the file, [cudatext-for-mathly-macosx.tar.gz](https://github.com/fdformula/MathlyLua/blob/main/cudatext-for-mathly-macos.tar.gz). Expand the downloaded file
and refer to the included file, `note.txt`, for other steps.

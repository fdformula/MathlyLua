## [Lite XL](https://github.com/lite-xl/lite-xl) is a very good "IDE" for Lua + Mathly

It is even smaller and faster than [CudaText](https://github.com/fdformula/MathlyLua/tree/main/IDE%20-%20CudaText), another very good "IDE" for Lua + Mathly. You can download here the customized
versions for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. While in Lite XL, press
```
  F1               to open help document on current Lua/Mathly function
  F2               to start Lua interpreter with Mathly loaded in the folder of the current file
  Ctrl-,           to run the command on current line or selected code in the editor
  Ctrl-.           to run all code in the editor (HTML file? open it in a browser)
```

&rArr; Microsoft Windows users may download on this very page the file, `lite-xl-*-for-mathly-windows.7z`. It includes the text editor, Lite XL, with Lua 5.4.8 and
Mathly integrated. Run [7zip](https://7-zip.org/) to extract it to C:\ (the root directory of the C drive). <em>Do not change the name of the folder,
`C:\cygwin`</em>.
